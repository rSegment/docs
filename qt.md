- [How To Really, Truly Use QThreads; The Full Explanation](http://mayaposch.wordpress.com/2011/11/01/how-to-really-truly-use-qthreads-the-full-explanation/) - A small tutorial on how to use QThreads in 99% of all cases. The suggested approach in the official documentation is to sub-class QThread, which is unneeded, inefficient and error-prone. This tutorial shows how to use QThreads without sub-classing and with proper resource management when the thread exits.
